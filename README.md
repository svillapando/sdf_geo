# PRISM â€“ Procedural Representation of Implicit Surfaces for Modeling



PRISM is a composable Signed Distance Function (SDF) framework for geometric modeling and optimization within the Computational System Design Language (CSDL)



## Features

\- Primitive SDFs: sphere, box, capsule, plane

\- Operations: smooth union, intersection, subtraction

\- Visualization tools for 2D slices and 3D isosurfaces

### Installation Instructions

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/svillapando/sdf_geo.git
```
