# PRISM – Procedural Representation of Implicit Surface Modeling



PRISM is a composable Signed Distance Function (SDF) framework for geometric modeling and optimization within the Computational System Design Language (CSDL)



## Features

\- Primitive SDFs: sphere, box, capsule, plane, cylinder

\- Operations: smooth union, intersection, subtraction

\- Visualization tools for 2D slices, 3D isosurfaces, and Eikonal violations

### Installation Instructions
